    <div> "B" is the first letter in bloodlusted, and for good reason. For too long, "B" has played second fiddle to "A". 
    "B" is Luigi, "B" is Squidward, "B" is "the machine" of Florence + fame. All this time being not quite the best has
    given "B" plenty of opportunities to ponder, to imagine, to plot. "B" knows every hour of "A"s schedule. "B" knows when
    "A" is alone. "B" knows that homicide falls under california penal code section 187, and "B" has found some creative
    loopholes in said code.   </div>
