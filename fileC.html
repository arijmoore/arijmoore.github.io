    <div>"C" has got a really great thing going on. "C" is like Poseidon to A's Zeus and B's Hades. C is like Kevin Jonas. Sure, not the hottest
        nor the most talented, but always included in a conversation about the trio. Another fun thing about "C", it sounds like the word "see."
        Now you may be saying "well 'B' sounds like 'be' and 'bee' and 'A' sounds like 'a'" and man you must be a lot of fun at parties huh?
        Auspiciously, "C" is the first letter in catastrophe and crisis. Not like I'm paranoid or anything. "C" is great. I love "C". Who's asking?</div>
