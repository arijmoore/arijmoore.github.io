    didnâ€™t happen. Instead, technology has been marshaled, if anything, to figure out
    ways to make us all work more. In order to achieve this, jobs have had to be created
    that are, effectively, pointless."></div>

    <div class=text>"C" has got a really great thing going on. "C" is like Poseidon to A's Zeus and B's Hades. C is like Kevin Jonas.

  <div class=text>Sure, not the hottest
        nor the most talented, but always included in a conversation about the trio. Another fun thing about "C", it sounds like the word "see."
        Now you may be saying "well 'B' sounds like 'be' and 'bee' and 'A' sounds like 'a'" and man you must be a lot of fun at parties huh?</div>
</p>
<p> <div class=text> Auspiciously, "C" is the first letter in catastrophe and crisis. Not like I'm paranoid or anything. "C" is great. I love "C". Who's asking?</p>
