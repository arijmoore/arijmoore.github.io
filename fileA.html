    <div>The head honcho, the most front-facing of all the letters, "A" knows what it is. "A" is a Leo; "A" goes to CMC; "A" created a lesson for 
    <a href='https://www.masterclass.com/'>Master Class</a> during quarantine. "A" has a fitness trainer named Christiano that it sees every 
    Monday and Thursday. "A" used to try not letting all the attention get to its head, but you can only piously ignore the reality of your 
    fame for so long. If apple didn't start with "A" we all know it wouldn't have its current place as the perennial fruit example. I haven't 
    personally met "A" before, though I saw it once eating at Nobu (I was hiding under one of the tables, eating whatever fell on the floor). 
    Its tan was real, its smile was fake, and its vibe was immaculate. The floor kanpachi was delicious. </div>
