    <div> Hi, I'm Ari. You may be thinking, "I'm almost sure you're not a letter." And you'd be correct. I'm the tyrant that rules the lands of this html page. 
        With just a wish and some key strokes, I decide what code lives and dies. I also decided that I don't want to create 26 individual html files for this 
        letter reviewing website. That's why you're reading this instead of some treatise about my thoughts on "G" or "S" or something (though I want you to know
        that I think "S" is a hot letter). Some fun facts about me are that my great grandfather (whom I'm named after) went to prison for several years due to
        embezzlement from BIC pen company. Also, I was in a rock musical in 8th grade called Pok√©pocalypse about Pokemon gaining class consciousness and murdering
        their trainers, the songs were twists on Katy Perry and Muse. I'm an ENFP on the Meyers-Briggs, and I can recite the first 50 digits of pi.
